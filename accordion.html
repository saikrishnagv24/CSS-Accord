                    HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of the World Wide Web. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages, defining their structure and content. HTML uses tags and elements to organize text, images, links, and other multimedia content, instructing a web browser on how to display it.

                JavaScript is a versatile and popular programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. It allows developers to add functionality beyond the static content of HTML and CSS, enabling things like interactive menus, form validation, and animations. It's also used for server-side development and mobile application development.
